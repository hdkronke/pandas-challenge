PyCity Schools Written Report

Summary

After reviewing the data, we can see clear benefits of Charter schools for these high school students.
Compared to their District counterparts, Charter school students are performing better in math and reading.
We can also see a more notable stat: there is a sharp climb in percentage of students passing both.
There is a roughly 35% jump of "% Overall Passing" on the "per_school_summary!
This is incredibly important for setting up students for success and speaks to human learning habits.
Speaking of which, we see math scores are uniformly lower than reading scores regardless of school type, size, or budget!
Clearly math is just a tougher subject for students, and Charter schools are providing a more effecient learning environment.

Conclusions

There is a sharp decline in passing scores once a school surpasses 2000 students.
To make sure students are getting the individual attention they deserve, we should consider pushing budgets into multiple/smaller schools rather than single/larger schools.
Schools with larger budgets are showing similar results, clearly we can't raise test scores with money.

When we are comparing school types, we see Charter schools being more consistant with their averages.
District schools average scores range from the mid-70's in math to low-80's in reading, where Charter schools settle in the mid-80's in both subjects.
Math might require a little more time and attention for students and they appear to be better accommodated in Charter schools.
