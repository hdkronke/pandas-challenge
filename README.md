# Pandas Challenge
## Module 4 Challenge
For this project, I've used Pandas and Python to analyze this dataset on High Schools around the United States.

The information is used to create Pandas Dataframes to better visualize the material.

There are several ways to recontextualize the data, including organizing passing grades by high school year and school name.

Looking closer, I am also able to see how average funding spent per student relates to average passing grade.

The data suggests that student grades in charter schools outperfom district schools by a substantial margin!
